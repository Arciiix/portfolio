            Control your smart home devices effortlessly with various hand
            gestures -{" "}
            <b>I built and trained a classifier (Random Forest) model</b> by
            myself. It gets the angles between different body joints (thanks to
            MediaPipe and some magic (math to be specific)) as input data and
            outputs the corresponding gesture ID. This sophisticated model
            accurately interprets your hand movements, enabling seamless
            interaction with your IoT devices.

        <span>
          Recently, I&apos;ve been really interesting in{" "}
          <b>machine learning and computer</b> vision. The primary reason behind
          my projects in general is to address some problem, often related to
          human shortcomings, like laziness. The same was true for{" "}
          <span className="text-teal-400 font-bold">Handy</span> - outside my
          house, we have <b>a music player</b> (Volumio) that usually plays
          online radio. However,{" "}
          <b>
            sometimes it&apos;s too loud, sometimes too quiet, and sometimes it
            would be helpful to know the time or check the weather
          </b>
          , and so on. Nobody in my family wants to rush inside the house to
          grab their phone (for example when working in the garden) just to
          check these things. That&apos;s why I came up with the idea of
          creating something that, using existing hardware (the total cost of
          this project is literally $0, with no need to install anything new),
          namely a surveillance camera and the music player I mentioned, would
          make this process easier.{" "}
          <b>
            Handy recognizes gestures that allow you to control devices in my
            home IoT network

          , including that player. Was there a problem? Yes. Is there a
          solution? Always.
