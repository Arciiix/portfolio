          Stream PC audio or microphone to mobile easily, in the blink of an
          eye. You&apos;re on your PC that doesn&apos;t have Bluetooth and you
          want to use your portable speaker? Use this app. Or even if your
          computer has Bluetooth, it is limited in the range of usability - want
          to extend your area of music as much as you would like? This app is a
          perfect fit.
